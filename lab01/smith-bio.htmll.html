    <body>
        I'm Victoria Smith. 
        I am a Geography major and I am interested in GIS map making. 
        Outside of school, I like to bake, read, and consume a variety of different media with friends.
        I am from Denton, Texas which is a small-ish town in the DFW region. It is often considered the "mini" Austin.
