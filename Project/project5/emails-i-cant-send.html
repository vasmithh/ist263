                    <dt>1. things i wish you said</dt>
                    <dd>The last verse of this song specifically struck a nerve for me. When Carpenter sang “sorry that I pulled the it’s not you it’s me” I felt a lump in my throat. I think we have all been in a position where sometimes it’s just easier to blame yourself than talk about the real issues or feelings, especially in relationships. But just because it’s easier doesn’t make it better…something I am still learning to this day.</dd>
                    <dt>2. how many things</dt>
                    <dd>How can you go from knowing someone like the back of your hand to just complete strangers…Better yet how can they go from knowing every little thing about you, from seeing every part of you to treating you like a ghost. Am I even a ghost in their life? Haunting their mind. This song captures this exact feeling. Do they think about me? Because all you can think about is them.  </dd>
                    <dt>3. Bad for buisness</dt>
                    <dd>Have you ever had a thing for someone who was absolutely hated…I’m not talking about your normal “you deserve better” and “what do you see in him” situation. I mean completely full of hatred. Sadly, I can say I have…not once…but twice. But for some reason there's something so soul consuming about them that you can't shake. You can feel yourself losing who you are. Sleeping through the day, not caring about any of your commitments, not eating or taking care of yourself. I’ve been there. I’ve seen it. Carpenter perfectly captures this feeling in this upbeat tune. What do you do when you are completely, entirely, deeply in love with someone despite them ruining all your plans in life? </dd>
                    <dt>4. Already Over </dt>
                    <dd>Bad habits are hard to break…and so are toxic relationships/friendships. “Say I’m done but I’m still confused, how am I supposed to leave you when I still need closure.” These are some of the realest lyrics I’ve ever heard…</dd>
                    <dt>5. opposite</dt>
                    <dd>I don’t think I need to elaborate very much on this one. He wanted an outgoing, blonde, athletic type. I was the brunette, book-reading, shy type.</dd>
                    <dt>6. Tornado warnings</dt>
                    <dd>“I’m lying to my therapist” ...now if I had a nickel for every time I lied about my true honest feelings…I’d be the richest girl in the world. It’s hard to be honest to other people when you can’t even be honest with yourself.</dd>
                    <dt>7. decode</dt>
                    <dd>This song captures the mind of an overthinker perfectly. Re-reading text messages, replaying every conversation in your head over and over and over again. It gets exhausting; trying to “decode” every undertone and figure out where it exactly went wrong.</dd>
                </dl> 
            </div>
            <div class="flex-container-three"> 
                <dl>
                    <dt>8. Read your mind</dt>
                    <dd>I think this song is also pretty self-explanatory. I think everyone has had a moment where they wished they knew just exactly what someone was thinking. It goes back to the overthinking discussed prior. It is exhausting trying to figure someone out.</dd>
                    <dt>9. Vicious</dt>
                    <dd>I think it's at this point in the list where things get a little less relatable. This one has some relatability to it because I think no matter what there is always some sort of bitterness towards someone you don't speak to anymore.</dd>
                    <dt>10. bet u wanna</dt>
                    <dd>Why is it after you finally grow the courage to move forward and be the bigger person, people always come back and try to find a way to prevent that?</dd>
                    <dt>11. Fast times</dt>
                    <dd>I move wayyyyyyyy too fast. I need to pump the brakes and process my emotions before being too irrational.</dd>
                    <dt>12. Nonsense</dt>
                    <dd>This song is exactly what it feels like to have a silly little crush on somebody.</dd>
                    <dt>13. Lonesome</dt>
                    <dd>Back to the overthinking that presents itself in this album. This song is all about being in your head too much and how lonely and isolating that feeling can be</dd>
                    <dt>14. because i liked a boy</dt>
                    <dd>This song talks about how liking a certain boy single handedly ruined her public image, her self-esteem, and her trust.</dd>
                    <dt>15. emails i can't send</dt>
                    <dd>I can’t relate to this song entirely because I am fortunate enough to have two parents who are madly in love with each other. I can however relate to having witnessed and experienced toxic relationships that alter the way you think and behave in future situations.</dd>
                    <dt>16. skinny dipping</dt>
                    <dd>This song is also not super relatable to me because I have never had the experience of running into someone, I used to be so close with and not feeling a single thing. It’s about being at peace and looking back at your time in a reflective manner. I hope one day to find this peace.</dd>
                    <dt>17. Feather</dt>
                    <dd>Unfortunately, this song is not super relatable to me. I am too much of a people pleaser to block people even if they wronged me.</dd>
