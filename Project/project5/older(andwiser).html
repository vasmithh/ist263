                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <li>1. Better than this</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When I first heard this song, I had a strong visceral reaction. Lizzy McAlpineperfectly encapsulates the feeling of settling for something because it's obtainable and not something you actually want. She talks about how she feels like she is not truly understood in her relationship and how she needs to find and more importantly capable of finding someone who will love her “better than this.” </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>2. Force of nature</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It’s difficult when you feel unexplainable guilt because someone idolizes you so much and thinks you can do no wrong. I was in a relationship where I was trying to mess up or piss them off because I couldn't handle them thinking I was some perfect being. This song describes this feeling well.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>3. Staying</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This song is the perfect combination of the prior two songs. Lizzy talks about staying in a relationship because it’s “familiar” and feeling guilty about the possibility of leaving, but it's not what she wants. She talks about her partner “loving [her] dry” because she just can't grasp the idea of being idolized. I know this experience all too well. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>4. You forced me to</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Tell me why you think you love me, I am guilty, you're a fool.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>5. Moive star</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Being idolized. It’s fun at first but it gets old quick. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>6. I guess </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I think I speak for us all when I say, “you always want what you can’t have”; it's just human nature. We crave the feeling of satisfaction and when we get complacent, we lose the thrill of searching for satisfaction. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>7. Come down soon</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“It all comes down on you” she says in a pessimistic tone.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>8. Method acting</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It all goes back to being idolized. This song is like the concept of imposter syndrome. Not feeling like the person, they see you as. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>9. All falls down</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Similar to Come down soon…basically just being pessimistic and thinking anytime something good happens, bad is lurking around the corner.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>10. Spring into summer</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“I’m always forever running back to you” I think is relatable in the sense that it's easy to just go back and fall into your old habits. It's easy. It's familiar. So, when things get hard or you're having a low moment, we run back to the feeling of familiarity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>11. Like it tends to do</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hoping to see them in public just to feel that sense of familiarity again.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <li>12. Pushing it down and praying</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Filling the void. Searching for someone to fill the void. Fill the void of heartache. Searching for them in the next. Searching for that familiarity again.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>13. Drunk running</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I fear being the root of someone else's problems. Especially if the problem is an addiction.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>14. Vortex</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As I’ve said before…I am a girl who feels a lot of unexplainable guilt. I feel responsible for everyone else's feelings and that my feelings are less than. Lizzy sings at one point “maybe one day I’ll be kinder to myself” and it’s something I truly hope and believe I will reach one day.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>17. Soccer practice</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“I’m waiting for someone who will make me say no to you” describes the feeling of searching for familiarity yet again…</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>18. Elevator</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wanting everything to stay the same so there is no hassle in your life, yet you're not satisfied. You want change but you're too scared of the process.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Fortunately, I have not been in a relationship where physical violence has occurred. Not a super relatable song to me.</li>
