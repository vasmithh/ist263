        <h2> about </h2>
        <p> I am a 20 year old college student with big feelings and not a lot of time to dwell on things. One way I have always managed my emotions is through music. Listening to it, writing it, analyzing it, you name it. I began to do this thing when I was 17 years old. I would rank the songs from my favorite albums on how well they explained my situation; How “relatable” they were to me. I started this little therapeutic diary with <em>emails I can’t send fwd: </em> an album by Sabrina Carpenter. I felt immediate relief being able to take some time to recognize and explain how I felt. I always had a difficult time journaling the “normal way” because I couldn’t find the words to describe how I felt. Instead I listened to music that wrote how I felt for me! I felt less alone. I felt understood. And so I share with you those feelings, those songs, in hopes to make you feel less alone or maybe to just find a new album to listen to. </p>

        <p> me at some of my favorite concerts! </p>
