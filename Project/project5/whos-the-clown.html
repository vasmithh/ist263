                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <li>1. Sue me</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Sue me I want to be wanted” </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>2. Shooting star </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I consider myself to be a semi spiritual person. I’m not really religious or anything but if there is one thing I believe in, it’s a sign. However, it’s difficult to decipher the meanings of these signs. Hobert sings “girl that’s not a shooting star, I’m sorry my bad I thought that it was” basically meaning she’s mistaken by whatever “sign” in her life she’s been met with. Basically, what I am trying to say is that Audrey Hobert is just as delusional as I am. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>3. Thirst Trap</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unfortunately, I am very concerned with what others think of me and how I am perceived. This song is pretty much explaining what it’s like to have a crush and putting on this facade to seem “more likeable.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>4. Sex and the City</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sex and the city is one of my favorite tv shows of all time so for there to be a song written about it…I knew it was going to be important to me. Similar to shooting star, Hobert talks about how she's a big believer in “everything happens for a reason” and that life isn't as glamorous as Carrie Bradshaw makes it out to be.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>5. Phoebe</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I think everyone has had a moment of feeling like the odd one out or feeling a bit kooky. If you’ve seen the show Friends (another one of my favorites) the character Phoebe is who inspired the title.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>6. Wet hair</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I hate to admit it, but I do like attention from time to time. This song is a bit silly, as most of these all are. Hobert talks about showing up to a party with wet hair to seem like she was nonchalant and “didn’t care” hoping to grasp the attention fromother people at the party.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>7. I like to touch people</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don’t be afraid of this title like I initially was. This song is about more people pleasing and how Hobert likes to touch people’s hearts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>8. Bowling Alley</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This song is all about being a people pleaser but also seeking/craving attention… a pretty common theme. “It doesn't need to be about me all the time” is something that I must remind myself of from time to time as sad as it sounds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>9. Silver jubilee</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This song has the ultimate “I don’t want to be sad anymore let’s party” vibe.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
             </div>
             <div class="flex-container-three">
                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <li>10. Chateau</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This song is more about not feeling like you fit in and wanting to get out of a place you don't belong. Hobert is specifically talking about an experience she had in Chateau Marmont, a super-rich and famous hotel in Los Angeles. Being a girl from a small town in North Texas, I think you can figure out why this probably isn't the most relatable song for me.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>11. Don't go back to his ass</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unfortunately, I’m a sucker for a good second chance. A redemption arc. Believe people can change. And because of that, this song is not relatable to me.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>12. Drive</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I am not a super big go with the flow type person. I am never “putting it in drive.” I am constantly pumping the brakes and analyzing the best route to take.</li>
                        </ul>
